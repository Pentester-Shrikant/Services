# Web Application VAPT

### What Is VAPT:
VAPT stands for Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing. It's a comprehensive security testing approach used to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in an organization's systems, networks, and applications.

- Vulnerability Assessment: This involves systematically scanning and analyzing systems for known vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and weaknesses. It aims to identify potential entry points that attackers could exploit to compromise security.
- Penetration Testing: Also known as ethical hacking, penetration testing goes beyond vulnerability assessment by simulating real-world attacks on systems and applications. Penetration testers attempt to exploit identified vulnerabilities to assess the effectiveness of security controls and to provide actionable recommendations for mitigation.

- Together, VAPT provides a holistic view of an organization's security posture, helping to identify and address potential risks before they can be exploited by malicious actors.
